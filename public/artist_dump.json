age of 14. By 15, his work appeared on local college radio and commercial stations in his hometown of Burlington, and began to spread to other cities. Towards the end of high school, Morgan got his own radio show at The University of Vermont, filling in for a friend on a popular Saturday night slot. This turned into a weekly endeavor that introduced Morgan to the vast assortment of electronic music that came by the boxload every week.

Party people at heart, the pair met when Simon signed Max to the Down Boy record label that he worked for. Musically, Simon found his enthusiasm for house on the dance floor in the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s promoting nights and DJing, while Max got into production via a passion for techno honed whilst throwing illegal raves in his native city of Gothenburg. In 2008 they found a new home at Defected Records, leaving Positiva after 4 years. Since joining Defected they have already made their mark at the world\u2019s leading house music label."}}, {"artist": {"name": "Mischa Daniels", "large": null, "medium": null, "created_at":

After years of gathering experience with almost every style of music he made his decision for Trance &amp; Progressive and focused on that quite early. That is the Sound he found for himself and which he likes very much.
